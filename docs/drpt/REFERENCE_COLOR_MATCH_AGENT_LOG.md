# Reference Color Match Agent Log

## 2026-07-27 - Start product reference-look Goal

- Node/parent goal: NFCM-P1 / neuro-film uploaded reference-photo matching.
- Trigger: user explicitly requested implementation in this chat using Goal.
- Skills used: `dev-research-reliability` primary; router, AI/ML, DRPT,
  plan-tracker, project-log and structure stewardship as read-only governance.
- Decisions: use isolated branch/worktree; implement image-first
  `WorkingImage -> LookRecipe -> batch WorkingImage`; do not duplicate D-PCT
  media/video work or main-chat W1/W2 research.
- Files changed: coordination record, product plan and this branch log only.
- Verification evidence: both active task states and three Git worktrees were
  read before the claim; this worktree began clean at `c03c321...`.
- Risks or unknowns: safe-Lab mean/std is only a deterministic baseline, not
  evidence of final photographic/aesthetic superiority.
- Handoff state: P0 active; implementation remains gated on committing the
  coordination contract.

## 2026-07-27 - Freeze coordination contract

- Changed: P0 coordination, plan and dedicated branch log committed as
  `ec001b2`; EOF whitespace normalized in `acb0c82`.
- Evidence: `git diff --check` passes after the normalization commit.
- Next: P1 implements only the immutable recipe/fitting contract and focused
  tests under the claimed file scope.

## 2026-07-27 - Complete P1 recipe contract

- Changed: added immutable v1 reference-look policy/recipe, canonical SHA-256
  identity, strict JSON roundtrip and a `WorkingImage`-only fitting entrypoint.
- Evidence: 30 tests pass across the new contract tests and existing Lab/gamut
  regressions. System Python lacked pytest; tests used the project's existing
  Python 3.12 `.venv` without installing dependencies.
- Risks: the recipe currently freezes mean/std Lab statistics; it is explicitly
  labeled a deterministic statistical baseline.
- Next: P2 adds deterministic single/batch application without changing this
  recipe contract.

## 2026-07-27 - Complete P2 batch renderer

- Changed: added deterministic safe-Lab application, explicit source/chroma
  gamut policy, ordered N-source batch API and per-source diagnostics.
- Evidence: 44 tests pass across reference-match contracts/rendering and
  existing Lab/gamut tests. Repeated rendering is byte-identical; batch order
  does not affect any source result; inputs and metadata containers are not
  mutated.
- Boundaries: display-linear SDR only; scene-linear RAW and out-of-gamut source
  pixels fail closed.
- Next: P3 persists recipe files atomically and proves load/replay identity.
